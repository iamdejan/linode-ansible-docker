# Linode-Ansible-Docker

This is a Terraform script to provision Docker Swarm cluster in Linode servers using Ansible playbooks.

## Getting started
1) Initiate the Terraform project: `terraform init`
2) See the execution plan: `terraform plan`
3) Execute the plan: `terraform plan [-auto-approve]`
    - `-auto-approve` usage is optional. Use only if you're sure with the plan or you setup an CI/CD pipeline.
